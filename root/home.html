                    <h2><strong>Street Photography</strong> </h2>
                    <p>is a famous photography genre. It is about <em>documenting people on the street</em>. <mark>Finding
                            creative ways to capture life.</mark></p>
                    <p><dfn><big>S</big>treet photography</dfn>, also sometimes called candid photography, is photography
                        conducted for art or enquiry that features unmediated chance encounters and random incidents[1]
                        within public places. Although there is a difference between <i>street</i> and <i>candid
                            photography</i>, it is usually subtle with most street photography being candid in nature and
                        some candid photography being classifiable as <b>street photography</b>.</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 1838 or 1839 the <b>first photograph</b> of figures in the street was recorded by
                        <em>Louis-Jacques-Mand√©</em> Daguerre in one of a pair of daguerreotype views taken from his studio
                        window of the <i>Boulevard du Temple</i> in Paris. <b>The second</b>, made at the height of the day,
                        <i>shows an unpopulated stretch of street</i>, while the other was taken at about 8:00 am, and as
                        Beaumont Newhall reports, "The Boulevard, so constantly filled with a moving throng of pedestrians
                        and carriages was perfectly solitary, except an individual who was having his boots brushed. His
                        feet were compelled, of course, to be stationary for some time, one being on the box of the boot
                        black, and the other on the ground. Consequently his boots and legs were well defined, but he is
                        without body or head, <mark>&#34;because these were in motion&#34;</mark>.

                    <h2>What do you need? </h2>
                    <p>You need to have a good knowledge about composition and color theory. You need to remember that
                        street photography is an Art. You need a compact camera. The reason for this is that you want to be
                        incognito and fast when taking pictures. You do not want to miss an <sub>awesome </sub>shot.</p>
                   
                    <p>&ominus;<s>Expensive</s> camera is not required to start street photography! &timesb;</p>
                </section>
                    <h2>My Camera recommendation</h2>
                    <p>Based on my experience, I highly recommend getting a Fujifilm camera &hearts;. It produces an image
                        that is so perfect you do not need to post process your photos. You can upload the images straight
                        out of the camera. I suggest getting the Fujifilm x100v or x100f. These two cameras have a good
                        reputation in the street photography community. These particular models are very light and compact
                        you will not have any problems taking your shot &ofcir;.</p>
                    <p>Fujifilm is &#62; Sony!! but when it comes to professional portrait Fujifilm is &#60; Canon R+ </p>
                    <p>x100v is &approx; $1500 CAD</p>
                    <p>x100f is &approx; $1200 CAD</p>
                    <p> I will rate both &starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf; star</p>
