                                    One of the common used composition in Photography. It uses the 3x3 frame in your
                                    camera
                                    and placing the subject on the third line. It is not always a good idea to place
                                    your
                                    subject on the middle

                                <p>One of the fun ways to capture people is to frame them with different object. Think
                                    of a window, people walking, cars passing by and etc. The only limitation is your
                                    imagination. </p>

                                <p>Leading lines are lines that appear in a photograph that have been framed and
                                    positioned by the photographer to draw the viewer's eye towards a specific point of
                                    interest. These lines often draw the viewer’s eye in a specific direction or towards
                                    a designated portion of the photograph.</p>

                                <p>Color theory is the collection of rules and guidelines which designers use to
                                    communicate with users through appealing color schemes in visual interfaces. To pick
                                    the best colors every time, designers use a color wheel and refer to extensive
                                    collected knowledge about human optical ability, psychology, culture and more.</p>

                                <p>Long exposure photography is when we are using a much longer shutter speed, and it’s
                                    usually used as a specific technique to achieve a certain effect. There’s no defined
                                    transition point at which a shutter speed becomes slow enough to define your
                                    shooting as <q>long exposure photography</q>.</p>

                        <p>The most important thing is that you are having fun! Don't stress out about which camera or
                            which composition to use. Just go out there and start taking photos! The more time you spent
                            taking photos the faster you will master it.</p>
